Laced in Grace Blog PLAN:

1. Create a blog webpage that is responsive.
2. Create a loading page that when is loading it shows a rotating load gif.
3. Fixed background so when it scrolled down the background stays but the other stuff above it scrolls.
4.Each page would be a picture that takes almost the whole screen but there is either a pargraph above it or in the bottom.
5. If the paragraph is too big some of it will get hidden then a "Continue Reading" button will be made for it to drop down.
6. First two blogs would be like an introductory blogs so their pictures will be big then other else would be a 2 images x blog  each layou.
5.  There would be a small sidebar that is an  About Me page then with subscribe for the blog.
6. Navbar would have a simple design that is transparent, it will have the home page button which is just the name of the blog.
7. Then Email, Facebook, and instagram button(if the client wants it).
